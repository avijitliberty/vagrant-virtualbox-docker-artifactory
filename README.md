# vagrant-virtualbox-docker-artifactory

Goal is to get artifactory oss running on a Ubuntu VM in a quick start way and explore some of the inner workings under the hood. 
I would be following the steps as explained in the [JFrog Wiki](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Installing+Artifactory#InstallingArtifactory-docker_volumes).

Also checkout my "HowTo" post here: [Install Artifactory via Docker Compose](https://honeycomb-host.netlify.app/post/artifactory/)
